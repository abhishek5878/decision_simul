Decision Intelligence Summary Layer

This module provides the Decision Intelligence Summary — a human-readable
interpretation layer derived from the Decision Ledger.

The Decision Intelligence Summary is explicitly non-authoritative and is
designed for founder-facing product strategy discussions.

The Decision Ledger remains the authoritative, immutable record.
