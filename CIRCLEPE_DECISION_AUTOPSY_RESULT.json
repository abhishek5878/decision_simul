(2) Add 'See Full Details in App' button below the estimate. (3) Make app download optional - users can proceed with agent if they prefer.

(3) Value timing - We'll see which personas respond to early value vs which don't, enabling better segmentation. (4) Technical feasibility - We'll validate if we can show accurate estimates with minimal data in WhatsApp, which opens up other product opportunities.
