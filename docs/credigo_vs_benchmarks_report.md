## 1. What Credigo Filters Earlier Than Benchmarks

Credigo shows higher drop rates at these steps compared to benchmarks:

- **step_3**: Credigo 0.0% vs Zerodha 0.0% (inf× higher)
- **step_5**: Credigo 0.0% vs Zerodha 0.0% (inf× higher)
- **step_1**: Credigo 0.0% vs Zerodha 0.0% (inf× higher)
- **step_2**: Credigo 0.0% vs Zerodha 0.0% (inf× higher)
- **step_3**: Credigo 0.0% vs Groww 0.0% (inf× higher)

## 2. Where Credigo Asks for Commitment Sooner

### Value Delivery Timing

Credigo delivers first value at step 5 (personalized recommendation).

Benchmark comparison:
- **Groww**: First value at step 2 (browse mode, no signup)
- **CRED**: First value at step 4 (rewards view)
- **Zerodha**: First value at step 5 (account activated)

Credigo asks for 4 preference/data steps before showing value, similar to Zerodha but later than Groww and CRED.

## 3. Where Credigo is Structurally Strong

Steps where Credigo shows lower drop rates than benchmarks:

- **step_0**: Credigo 10.0% vs Zerodha 52.0% (5.2× lower)
- **step_0**: Credigo 10.0% vs Groww 52.0% (5.2× lower)
- **step_0**: Credigo 10.0% vs Cred 53.0% (5.3× lower)

### Credigo vs Cred

- **medium_energy**: More survive in Credigo (85.0% vs 47.5%)
- **low_energy**: More survive in Credigo (92.5% vs 55.0%)
- **high_energy**: More survive in Credigo (95.0% vs 30.0%)

## 6. Which Changes Would Matter vs Which Wouldn't

Sensitivity simulation results (Credigo-only perturbations):

### Reduce Effort

- **Step 0, 10% change**: 0.0% decision change rate
  → **Low impact**: This change would have minimal effect
- **Step 0, 20% change**: 0.0% decision change rate
  → **Low impact**: This change would have minimal effect
- **Step 0, 30% change**: 0.0% decision change rate
  → **Low impact**: This change would have minimal effect

### Increase Value Signal

- **Step 0, 10% change**: 0.2% decision change rate
  → **Low impact**: This change would have minimal effect
- **Step 0, 20% change**: 0.4% decision change rate
  → **Low impact**: This change would have minimal effect

Relative differences are more meaningful than absolute metrics. 
This analysis identifies structural differences, not optimization prescriptions.
