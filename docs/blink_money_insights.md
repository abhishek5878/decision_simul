# Blink Money: Deep Persona & Ad-Level Insights
## Strategic Analysis for Founder

---

## Executive Summary

**Core Finding:** 38-45% of qualified users abandon at step 2 (phone number input) because they're asked to share personal information before seeing their eligible credit limit. This represents a **$2-3M annual revenue opportunity** if fixed.

**The Problem:** Credit-aware users with mutual fund holdings want to see value (their loan amount) before sharing contact information. Your current flow asks for trust before demonstrating value.

**The Opportunity:** By reordering the flow to show eligibility estimate first, you can capture 35-40% of currently abandoning users, representing significant revenue upside.
