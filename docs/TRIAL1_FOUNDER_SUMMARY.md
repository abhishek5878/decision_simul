# Trial1: What Your Product Is Actually Doing

---

## DECISION COVER

**Your product converts 27% of users who arrive, and filters out 73% before they complete.** The filtering happens early—33% of all drop-offs occur in the first two steps. This isn't broken; it's a design choice. Your product prioritizes setup and configuration for users who are committed to collecting feedback, at the cost of converting users who need to see value before committing.

## THE FUNNEL

![Trial1 User Funnel](../output/trial1_funnel_chart.png)

**Most drop-offs happen in Steps 1-2.** If a user doesn't make it past the landing page and sign-up, they're unlikely to complete.

---

## THE PRIMARY DECISION BOUNDARY

### Step 1: "Landing Page - AI Tool Value Proposition"

**What's happening:**
- Users see the landing page and decide whether this tool will help them collect feedback
- This isn't a design problem—it's a selection mechanism
- Your product optimizes for users who already understand they need feedback collection
- It trades off the ability to convert users who need to see how feedback collection works

**Who drops:**
- Users who aren't sure this tool will help them collect feedback
- Users who need to see how feedback collection works before signing up
- Users who want to understand the value before providing their email

**Who continues:**
- Users who are already certain they want to collect user feedback
- Users ready to sign up and start setting up feedback collection
- Users who trust the value proposition

---

## THE CORE TRUTH

**Your product asks for commitment (email, setup) before showing how feedback collection works.**

Users who pass step 1 continue through the flow. Users who drop at step 1 aren't ready to commit yet—they need to see how the feedback collection process works first.

**What this means:**
- Your product prioritizes setup over demonstration
- It assumes users want to collect feedback and just need the tool
- This works for users who already know they need feedback collection
- It filters out users who need to see how it works before committing

**The tradeoff:**
- Faster setup for committed users (efficiency wins)
- Lower conversion of uncertain users (demonstration loses)

## DECISION TRADEOFFS

### Tradeoff 1: Setup vs. Demonstration

**Current approach:** Asks for email and setup before showing how feedback collection works

**Decision:** Do you prioritize setup (faster for committed users) or demonstration (show how feedback collection works before asking for commitment)?

**Your current approach favors setup.**

---

### Tradeoff 2: Commitment vs. Exploration

**Current approach:** Requires email sign-up early in the flow

**Decision:** Do you require commitment early (email before seeing value) or allow exploration (show feedback collection in action, then ask for email)?

**Your current approach favors early commitment.**

---

### Tradeoff 3: Configuration vs. Quick Start

**Current approach:** Requires configuration and setup before users can see feedback collection

**Decision:** Do you require full setup (better for committed users) or offer quick start (let users see feedback collection with minimal setup, then configure)?

**Your current approach favors full configuration.**

---

## THE UNAVOIDABLE QUESTION

**Your product works exactly as designed for users who are already committed to collecting user feedback.**

**Are you okay with filtering out users who need to see how feedback collection works before committing, or do you want to show the value first?**
