# Blink Money: Product Intelligence Brief

## What This Analysis Actually Did

This work modeled user decision-making, not clicks or drop-offs.

Instead of tracking where users leave, we simulated how different users interpret each step. What do they expect to see? What feels risky? What makes them trust enough to continue?

This reveals belief, expectation, perceived risk, and where trust collapses. The output isn’t a funnel report—it’s a map of how users reason through your product.

## Why Traditional Funnel Analysis Misses This

Funnel analytics show symptoms, not causes.

“Users dropped at step X” doesn’t explain why. The same step can fail for different reasons: one user leaves because they don’t see value yet, another because they’re comparing to alternatives, another because the request feels too risky.

Funnels show what happened. This shows why it happened—and why it will keep happening until the underlying structure changes.

## Persona-Level Patterns (What Repeats Across Users)

We modeled five user mindsets moving through your flow:

**Salaried professionals with mutual funds**
- Trying to confirm: Can I get liquidity without selling investments?
- Hesitation trigger: Long verification steps without seeing their credit limit
- What makes them proceed: Fast feedback on eligibility, clear terms

**Self-employed users**
- Trying to confirm: Will this impact my credit score? Is my data safe?
- Hesitation trigger: PAN/DOB request without strong reassurance
- What makes them proceed: Explicit “no credit score impact” messaging, security signals

**Credit-aware optimizers**
- Trying to confirm: Is this better than a personal loan? What are the rates?
- Hesitation trigger: Verification steps before seeing rate comparison
- What makes them proceed: Clear cost comparison vs alternatives early

**Speed-seekers**
- Trying to confirm: Can I get an answer quickly?
- Hesitation trigger: Five-step process feels slow for “instant liquidity”
- What makes them proceed: Quick estimate option, progress indicators

**Cost-conscious users**
- Trying to confirm: What will this actually cost me?
- Hesitation trigger: Reaching the end without clear interest rates and fees
- What makes them proceed: Transparent pricing upfront, EMI calculator

**What repeats across personas:**
All five abandon when asked to share personal information before seeing value. The specific reason varies, but the pattern is structural: trust demand exceeds relationship depth.

**What’s persona-specific:**
- Salaried users need speed; self-employed need security reassurance
- Credit-aware users need comparison; cost-conscious need transparency
- Speed-seekers need instant feedback

When different personas fail at the same moment for different reasons, it signals a structural flaw, not a targeting problem.

## The Core Structural Insight

The flaw is sequencing and trust, not UX or copy.

**The problem:** Irreversible actions (sharing phone, PAN, OTP) appear before reversible value (seeing credit limit).

Users are asked to trust before they see what they’ll get. This mismatch triggers abandonment. It’s not about the quality of your copy or the design of your forms—it’s about the order of operations.

**Why this matters:**
- Irreversible actions feel like commitments
- Reversible value feels like exploration
- When commitment comes before exploration, users leave

The fix isn’t better messaging around the phone number field. It’s showing the credit limit estimate earlier—after phone + PAN, before OTP. This establishes value before asking for more trust.

## Non-Obvious Blind Spots This Surfaces

Three assumptions that quietly fail in early-funnel credit products:

**“Users expect to give this information”**
They don’t. Users expect to explore first, then commit. Asking for a phone number before showing eligibility feels like a bait-and-switch. They came to see what they qualify for, not to fill out a form.

**“Brand trust compensates for early friction”**
Not in early-funnel. Users haven’t built trust with you yet. Partner logos and security badges help, but they don’t replace showing value first. Trust signals work when trust already exists—they don’t create it.

**“Progress indicators reduce anxiety”**
They can backfire. A “Step 2 of 5” indicator sets an expectation of completion, not a new high-friction requirement. When step 2 asks for personal data, the mismatch triggers abandonment. Progress indicators work when they match user expectations—they fail when they don’t.

These assumptions work in mid-funnel or for established products. They break in early-funnel credit products where users are evaluating, not committing.

## What the Founder Likely Already Senses (and Why This Matters)

You probably sense something is off—users leave before seeing value, or the flow asks for too much too early.

This converts that intuition into a precise, testable product decision. Instead of “maybe we should show the limit earlier,” you get: “Show the credit limit estimate after phone + PAN, before OTP. This reduces the trust-value gap that causes abandonment.”

This is about clarity, not cleverness. It’s about seeing what’s actually happening, not what you hope is happening.

## Why This Approach Is Powerful

**Fast:** Insights in hours, not weeks of A/B tests.

**Low-risk:** Changes are easy to test and roll back. You can A/B test with a small percentage of traffic and revert if needed.

**Reversible:** Every recommendation includes what you’ll learn even if it fails. This isn’t about being right—it’s about learning what users actually value.

**Shared understanding:** Product, growth, and engineering can align on the same diagnosis. Instead of debating whether the problem is UX or copy or targeting, everyone sees the same structural issue.

The output isn’t a report—it’s a clear, testable hypothesis with implementation steps, risk assessment, and learning goals.

## Closing Insight

This isn’t about being clever. It’s about seeing the product the way your best users do—before they leave.
