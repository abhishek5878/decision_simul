## Key Insights

**What's Working:**
- 51.6% completion rate is moderate—product is functional but has room for improvement
- Users who get past landing page have reasonable completion rates

**What's Not Working:**
- **Landing page is the biggest barrier** (20.5% drop-off)
- Value proposition unclear to users
- Asking for email before showing value creates friction
- Too much setup/configuration before users can try the tool

**Primary Issue:**
The product asks users to commit (email, setup) before they see value, which conflicts with the user intent of "try quickly, see value, then decide."

---

## Recommendations

1. **Landing Page:** Clarify value proposition immediately—show what the tool does, not just what it is
2. **Email Collection:** Move after first use/value delivery, not before
3. **Setup:** Minimize configuration required for initial trial
4. **Value Delivery:** Ensure users see clear value in first use
5. **Intent Alignment:** Reduce cognitive load and decision-making in early steps
